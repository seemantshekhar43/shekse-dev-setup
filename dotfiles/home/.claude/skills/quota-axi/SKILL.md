# quota-axi

Report local agent-provider quota windows for routing-aware agents.

You do not need quota-axi installed globally - invoke it with `npx -y quota-axi`.

quota-axi is data only: it never routes, recommends, proxies, intercepts, logs in, imports
browser cookies, or mutates provider state. It reads local provider auth sources and calls
first-party provider quota, usage, billing, or entitlement endpoints; it never launches the
Claude, Grok, Pi, or Kimi CLIs, so it cannot spend the quota it measures.

## When to use

Use quota-axi whenever you need local quota headroom before deciding whether it is safe to
keep working on a provider, when the user asks about usage, rate limits, or remaining quota,
or when comparing supported local provider headroom side by side.

## Workflow

1. Run `npx -y quota-axi` for compact TOON output covering supported providers' quota windows.
2. Scope to one provider with `--provider claude` or to a subset with `--provider cursor,copilot,grok,kimi`.
3. Pass `--json` for the normalized machine-readable model instead of TOON. Read
   `quotaSemantics.effectiveAvailability` rather than treating a model window in isolation:
   account windows can bound every model, and `boundedBy` names every window included in the
   effective percentage. If relationship status is `partial` or `unknown`, do not infer one.
4. Pass `--full` to include account identity and per-source attempt details.
5. Run `npx -y quota-axi auth` to check local auth-source availability without printing
   secret values.
6. On macOS, Claude Keychain value reads are skipped by default until the user grants access once.
   If quota output reports `reason: keychain_access_required`, tell your user to run
   `quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt` once and approve Keychain access ("Always Allow").
   After that successful grant, plain `quota-axi` calls reuse the existing Keychain access
   marker to refresh live Claude quota without requiring the flag.
7. For a managed Codex installation, set `QUOTA_AXI_CODEX_BINARY` to its absolute executable
   path. quota-axi uses that exact executable for auth inspection and the read-only app-server
   fallback, and fails closed if the override is invalid.
8. For Kimi, quota-axi prefers a literal Pi-managed `kimi-coding` API key from
   `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/auth.json` (default `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`). If it is
   unavailable, quota-axi may reuse a fresh official Kimi Code CLI access token from
   `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/credentials/kimi-code.json` (default
   `$HOME/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`) without refreshing or writing credentials.

## Usage

```
usage: quota-axi [auth] [flags]
commands[2]:
  (none)=quota, auth
flags[6]:
  --provider <claude,codex,cursor,copilot,grok,kimi>, --json, --full, --allow-keychain-prompt, --help, -v/--version
examples:
  quota-axi
  quota-axi --provider claude
  quota-axi --provider cursor,copilot,grok,kimi
  quota-axi --json
  quota-axi --full
  quota-axi auth
```

## Tips

- Output is TOON-encoded and token-efficient by default; pass `--json` only when you need
  the normalized schema.
- Exit code 0 means at least one provider returned data (fresh or stale); exit code 1 means
  every provider failed; exit code 2 means a usage error.
- Percentages are not comparable across providers - quota-axi never claims one provider's
  percentage equals another's.
- Claude `--full` output exposes the authoritative OAuth profile `account.uuid` as
  `account.accountId` when Anthropic returns one; otherwise the account identity is explicitly
  marked unverified rather than inferred.
- The quota cache at `~/.cache/quota-axi/quotas.json` only ever holds normalized
  non-secret snapshots.
  Fresh provider reports with no windows clear stale provider snapshots instead of caching
  empty quota.
  The Claude Keychain access marker lives alongside it and contains no credential values.
